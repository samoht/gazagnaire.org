# Thomas Gazagnaire

<br/>

I am engineer at [Docker.] Previously, I co-founded [Unikernel Systems,]
where I was Chief Architect, to make [unikernels] easier to use so that
they can be shipped and deployed everywhere, while I also was Senior
Research Associate at the [University of Cambridge.] Before that, I was
CTO of [OCamlPro,] Principal Virtualisation Engineer at [OnApp,] and
Senior Software Engineer at [Citrix.] I completed my Ph.D on distributed
systems at [Inria] & [IRISA] in the [DistribCom] project and I obtained my
Master and Bachelor degrees from [ENS Lyon] and [ENS Rennes.]

I am one of the main authors of the the [MirageOS] operating system
library and the main developer of the [Irmin] Git-like distributed
store. I previously designed and lead the implementation [OPAM,] the
package manager for [OCaml] and I've worked on [XenServer.]

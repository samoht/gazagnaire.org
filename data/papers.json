      "abstract": "Network latency is a problem for all cloud services. It can be mitigated by moving computation out of remote datacenters by rapidly instantiating local services near the user. This requires an embedded cloud platform on which to deploy multiple applications securely and quickly. We present Jitsu, a new Xen toolstack that satisfies the demands of secure multi-tenant isolation on resource-constrained embedded ARM devices. It does this by using unikernels: lightweight, compact, single address space, memory-safe virtual machines (VMs) written in a high-level language. Using fast shared memory channels, Jitsu provides a directory service that launches unikernels in response to network traffic and masks boot latency. Our evaluation shows Jitsu to be a power-efficient and responsive platform for hosting cloud services in the edge network while preserving the strong isolation guarantees of a type-1 hypervisor.",

      "Diagnosis of a system consists in providing explanations to a supervisor from a partial observation of the system and a model of possible executions. This paper proposes a partial order diagnosis algorithm that recovers sets of scenarios which correspond to a given observation. Systems are modeled using High-level Message Sequence Charts (HMSCs), and the diagnosis is given as a new HMSC, which behaviors are all explanations of the partial observation. The main difficulty is that some actions of the monitored system are unobservable but may still induce some causal ordering among observed events. We first give an offline centralized diagnosis algorithm, then we discuss a decentralized version of this algorithm. We then give an online diagnosis algorithm, and define syntactic criteria under which the memory used can be bounded. This allows us to give a complete diagnosis framework for infinite state systems, with a strong emphasis on concurrency and causal ordering in behaviors. The last contribution of the paper is an application of diagnosis techniques to a security problem called anomaly detection. Anomaly detection consists in comparing what occurs in the system with usual/expected behaviors, and raising an alarm when some unusual behavior (meaning a potential attack) occurs.",

Unikernels are single-purpose appliances that are compile-time specialised into standalone kernels, and sealed against modification when deployed to a cloud platform. In return they offer significant reduction in image sizes, improved efficiency and security, and should reduce operational costs. Our Mirage prototype compiles OCaml code into unikernels that run on commodity clouds and offer an order of magnitude reduction in code size without significant performance penalty. The architecture combines static type-safety with a single address-space layout that can be made immutable via a hypervisor extension. Mirage contributes a suite of type-safe protocol libraries, and our results demonstrate that the hypervisor is a platform that overcomes the hardware compatibility issues that have made past library operating systems impractical to deploy in the real-world.",

    "abstract": "Scenario languages based on Message Sequence Charts (MSCs) have been widely studied in the last decade. The high expressive power of MSCs renders many basic problems concerning these languages undecidable. However, several of these problems are decidable for languages that possess a behavioral property called “existentially bounded”. Unfortunately, collections of scenarios outside this class are frequently exhibited by systems such as sliding window protocols. We propose here an extension of MSCs called causal Message Sequence Charts and a natural mechanism for defining languages of causal MSCs called causal HMSCs (CaHMSCs). These languages preserve decidable properties without requiring existential bounds. Further, they can model collections of scenarios generated by sliding window protocols. We establish here the basic theory of CaHMSCs as well as the expressive power and complexity of decision procedures for various subclasses of CaHMSCs. We also illustrate the modeling power of our formalism with the help of a realistic example based on the TCP sliding window feature.",

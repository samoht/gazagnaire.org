## Interests

My interests primarily involve the application of formal methods and
functional programming languages to complex-system engineering
problems. More generally, I have a wide range of research and
application interests including:

- Cloud-computing;
-  Distributed and concurrent systems;
- Verification (model-checking) of complex systems;
- Automatic fault-diagnosis and monitoring of complex systems;
- Application of functional programming to real-world problems;
- Compilation and optimization techniques;
- Partial-order theory.

I am doing most of my software developments in [OCaml] and my projects are
hosted on [GitHub.]

## Thomas Gazagnaire

I am engineer at [Docker.] Previously, I co-founded [Unikernel Systems,]
where I was Chief Architect, to make [unikernels] easier to use so that
they can be shipped and deployed everywhere, while I also was Senior
Research Associate at the [University of Cambridge.] Before that, I was
CTO of [OCamlPro,] Principal Virtualisation Engineer at [OnApp,] and
Senior Software Engineer at [Citrix.] I completed my Ph.D on distributed
systems at [Inria] & [IRISA] in the [DistribCom] project and I obtained my
Master and Bachelor degrees from [ENS Lyon] and [ENS Rennes.]

I am one of the main authors of the the [MirageOS] operating system
library and the main developer of the [Irmin] Git-like distributed
store. I previously designed and lead the implementation [OPAM,] the
package manager for [OCaml] and I've worked on [XenServer.]

## Interests

My interests primarily involve the application of formal methods and
functional programming languages to complex-system engineering
problems. More generally, I have a wide range of research and
application interests including:

- Cloud-computing;
-  Distributed and concurrent systems;
- Verification (model-checking) of complex systems;
- Automatic fault-diagnosis and monitoring of complex systems;
- Application of functional programming to real-world problems;
- Compilation and optimization techniques;
- Partial-order theory.

I am doing most of my software developments in [OCaml] and my projects are
hosted on [GitHub.]
